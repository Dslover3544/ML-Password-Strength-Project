# 🔐 Phishing URL Detector

## 📌 Project Overview
Phishing websites trick users into giving away sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or credit card details.  
In this project, we train a machine learning model that can classify URLs as **phishing** or **legitimate** using simple features.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset
We’ll use a small open-source phishing dataset (already included in this project).  
The dataset contains:
- Website URLs
- Extracted features (length of URL, presence of “@”, use of “https”, etc.)
- A label: `0` = Legitimate, `1` = Phishing

---

## ⚙️ Steps
1. **Load the dataset** into Google Colab  
2. **Explore the data** with Pandas and simple visualizations  
3. **Extract features** from URLs (e.g., URL length, special characters)  
4. **Split the dataset** into training and testing sets  
5. **Train a simple ML model** (Logistic Regression or Decision Tree)  
6. **Evaluate the model** with accuracy and confusion matrix  
7. **Test on new URLs** you provide

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open this project in **Google Colab**
2. Upload the dataset (`phishing_dataset.csv`) if not already included
3. Run the notebook cells step by step
4. Try classifying your own URLs

## ✨ Future Ideas
- Add more advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Use NLP techniques to analyze suspicious words in URLs  
- Build a simple web app with Flask or Streamlit

## 📚 Learning Goals
- Apply machine learning to a **real-world cybersecurity problem**  
- Practice with datasets, preprocessing, and evaluation  
- Understand how features impact classification models
